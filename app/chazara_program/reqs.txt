Users table exists
Voicemail table exists
recordings table exists

permissions:
superadmin sees all domains
admin sees all rabbeim for this domain
user sees just own recordings

rabbeim need to set numeric password for PS login

Question - extend existing recordings table, existing VM table, or new table?
recordings table better suited for core recordings like IVR menus etc.\
VM table better used for incoming.
Therefore:
v_chazara_recordings
chazara_recording_uuid, domain_uuid, user_uuid, created_epoch, length, (filename is recording_uuid just like voicemail), enabled, category

v_chazara_grades
user_uuid, domain_uuid, grade
